			"solution":"Data should be transmitted at the rate of 500 Mbps.<br>Transmission Time &gt;= 2*Propagation Time<br>=&gt; 10000/(500*1000000)<br>&gt;= 2*length/200000<br>=&gt;<br> length = 2km (max)<br>so, answer will be: (B) 2km "

			"question":"Frames of 1000 bits are sent over a 10^6 bps duplex link between two hosts. The propagation time is 25ms. Frames are to be transmitted into this link to maximally pack them in transit (within the link). What is the minimum number of bits (i) that will be required to represent the sequence numbers distinctly? Assume that no time gap needs to be given between transmission of two frames",
